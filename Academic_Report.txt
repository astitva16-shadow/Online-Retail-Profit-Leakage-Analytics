  PART 1 : DASHBOARD ARCHITECTURE EXPLANATION
================================================================================

1.1  Architecture Overview
─────────────────────────

The dashboard follows a single-page, tabbed architecture built on Streamlit with
Plotly for interactive visualisations. The design philosophy prioritises a
business-intelligence (BI) interface that moves from summary to detail, mirroring
how an executive or analyst would naturally interrogate profit leakage data.

Architecture layers:

    DATA LAYER            -->  Excel ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering
    FILTER LAYER          -->  Sidebar controls (date, country, category, price band)
    COMPUTATION LAYER     -->  KPI calculations, aggregations, cohort logic
    PRESENTATION LAYER    -->  Five themed tabs with Plotly charts
    INTERACTION LAYER     -->  Simulation sliders, filter reactivity

1.2  Tab Structure and Rationale
────────────────────────────────

Tab 1 — Executive Profit Leakage Summary
    Purpose: Provide a single-screen financial overview answering "how severe is
    the return problem?"
    Components:
      - 8 KPI metric cards (gross revenue, return losses, net revenue, return
        rate, gross profit, net profit, profit erosion, transaction return rate)
      - Monthly revenue-vs-return trend (dual-axis bar+line chart)
      - Revenue waterfall (gross → COGS → gross profit → return losses → net profit)
      - Country-level return rate horizontal bar chart (top 15)
    Design rationale: The waterfall chart makes the profit drain visually
    immediate; the monthly trend reveals whether the problem is growing or stable.

Tab 2 — Product & Category Return Intelligence
    Purpose: Identify which products and categories are the biggest contributors
    to return losses.
    Components:
      - Top 15 products by absolute return loss
      - Category return rates (top 20 categories, filtered by minimum sales volume)
      - Price band vs return risk (dual-axis)
      - Pareto (80/20) concentration analysis
    Design rationale: Pareto analysis is critical — it quantifies exactly how
    many products need attention to recover 80% of losses.

Tab 3 — Customer Behaviour & Policy Risk
    Purpose: Profile customer-level return behaviour and identify high-risk
    segments.
    Components:
      - Top 15 customers by return loss
      - Customer risk segmentation pie chart (High / Medium / Low / No Returns)
      - Monthly cohort retention heatmap
      - Customer segmentation scatter (Spend vs Return Loss, sized by return count)
      - Temporal patterns (day-of-week and hour-of-day return rates)
    Design rationale: The cohort heatmap reveals whether returning customers
    are retained or churned; the scatter plot identifies the quadrant of
    high-spend-high-return customers who warrant policy intervention.

Tab 4 — Profit Lift Simulator
    Purpose: Model the financial impact of return-reduction strategies.
    Components:
      - Three interactive sliders (return reduction %, margin assumption,
        cost multiplier)
      - Current vs projected scenario comparison
      - Profit sensitivity curve
    Design rationale: Allows stakeholders to test "what-if" scenarios without
    modifying data, supporting evidence-based decision-making in meetings.

Tab 5 — Recommendations & Ethics
    Purpose: Translate analytics into actionable business interventions and
    address responsible use of customer data.
    Components:
      - Prioritised action tracker table (10 recommendations)
      - Ethical safeguards section (5 principles)
      - KPI definitions and assumptions reference

1.3  Technical Design Decisions
───────────────────────────────

- Caching: Streamlit's @st.cache_data decorator ensures the Excel file is read
  only once per session, even when filters change.
- Filter reactivity: All charts recompute from the filtered DataFrame, not
  from pre-aggregated summaries, ensuring consistency.
- Profit assumptions: Explicitly stated — 40% gross margin, 60% COGS — because
  the dataset contains no cost data. This is a limitation, acknowledged and
  parameterised in the simulator.
- Dark theme: All Plotly charts use "plotly_dark" template with custom CSS for
  Streamlit components, providing a cohesive BI-tool aesthetic.
- Modularity: The code is organised into clearly labelled sections (data loading,
  filters, helpers, each tab) with inline documentation, making it easy to
  extend or modify individual components.

  PART 2 : PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING
================================================================================

2.1  Business Context
─────────────────────

The client is a UK-based online retailer specialising in unique all-occasion
gift items, with a customer base spanning 38 countries. Despite consistent or
growing top-line revenue, the organisation experiences declining net
profitability. Preliminary investigation points to product returns as a
significant and growing source of profit erosion.

2.2  Problem Statement
──────────────────────

While gross revenue for the observation period (December 2010 — December 2011)
totalled approximately GBP 8.91 million, return losses amounted to GBP 611,342
— representing 6.86% of gross revenue. When measured against estimated gross
profit (at 40% margin), these return losses consume 17.1% of the profit base.

The problem is not merely the aggregate return rate, but the concentration and
distribution of those returns across products, customer segments, price bands,
and geographies. Without understanding these dimensions, blanket return policies
risk alienating loyal customers while failing to address the actual sources of
leakage.

2.3  Analytical Objective
─────────────────────────

This project aims to:
  (a) Quantify the total financial impact of product returns on profitability.
  (b) Identify which products, categories, customer segments, and regions
      contribute disproportionately to return losses.
  (c) Model the profit recovery potential of targeted return-reduction strategies.
  (d) Provide actionable, ethically grounded recommendations for stakeholders.

================================================================================
  PART 4 : DATA CLEANING METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

4.1  Raw Data Profile
─────────────────────

  Total records          :  541,909
  Columns                :  8 (InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity,
                            InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country)

  Issue                         Count       Action Taken
  ─────────────────────────     ─────────   ──────────────────────────────────────
  Null CustomerID               135,080     Rows dropped (cannot attribute to customer)

4.4  Post-Cleaning Dataset
──────────────────────────

  Cleaned records  :  406,789
  Sales records    :  397,884
  Return records   :    8,905
  Data loss        :  24.9% of rows (primarily null CustomerID)

  Justification for aggressive cleaning: Rows without CustomerID cannot
  contribute to customer-level analytics (cohort analysis, risk segmentation,
  repeat-returner identification). Retaining them would inflate revenue figures
  while providing no actionable customer insight.


================================================================================
  PART 5 : DASHBOARD EXPLANATION (PAGE BY PAGE)
================================================================================

Page 1 — Executive Profit Leakage Summary
──────────────────────────────────────────
This page answers the C-suite question: "How much money are we losing to
returns?" Eight KPI cards display the headline financial metrics. The monthly
trend chart reveals whether return losses are growing proportionally with revenue
or accelerating. The waterfall chart translates the abstract concept of profit
erosion into a visual flow — executives can see exactly where GBP 8.91M of gross
revenue narrows to an estimated net profit of GBP 2.95M, with GBP 611K leaking
out through returns. The country horizontal bar chart highlights geographic
risk pockets, enabling regional managers to be held accountable.

Page 2 — Product & Category Return Intelligence
────────────────────────────────────────────────
This page answers: "Which products are the problem?" The top-15 products bar
chart isolates the individual SKUs generating the most return losses. The
category-level view aggregates to a higher taxonomy level, revealing whether
losses are isolated to individual products or systemic to a product type. The
price-band analysis tests the hypothesis that higher-priced items have higher
return rates (they do — the 50-1000 band shows significantly elevated risk).
The Pareto chart is the most strategically important visualisation: it
demonstrates that just 67 out of 1,944 returned products account for 80% of
all return losses, making targeted intervention highly efficient.

Page 3 — Customer Behaviour & Policy Risk
──────────────────────────────────────────
This page answers: "Who is returning products, and should we be concerned?" The
top-15 returner bar chart identifies individual customers whose return behaviour
may warrant investigation. The risk-segmentation pie chart categorises the entire
customer base into High / Medium / Low / No Returns tiers using a composite
rule based on return rate and absolute loss quartile. The cohort heatmap shows
monthly customer retention — critical because high-return customers who also
churn represent pure loss, whereas high-return customers who remain loyal may
justify a different intervention strategy. The scatter plot maps every customer
on a Spend-vs-ReturnLoss plane, with colour encoding risk tier and bubble size
encoding return frequency. Temporal charts reveal that certain days and hours
correlate with higher return rates, informing operational scheduling.

Page 4 — Profit Lift Simulator
──────────────────────────────
This page answers: "What happens if we reduce returns by X%?" Three sliders
allow the user to adjust return reduction percentage (0-100%), gross margin
assumption (20-60%), and return processing cost multiplier (1.0-1.5x). The
scenario comparison shows current vs projected net profit side by side. The
sensitivity curve plots net profit across all reduction levels, with a
vertical marker at the user's chosen target — this enables stakeholders to
identify diminishing-returns thresholds and set realistic targets.

Page 5 — Recommendations & Ethics
──────────────────────────────────
This page translates analytics into action. A prioritised recommendation table
lists 10 interventions ranked Critical / High / Medium / Low, each linked to a
specific finding from the preceding tabs. Five ethical safeguards address
customer fairness, data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and
proportionality — ensuring that return-reduction strategies do not inadvertently
harm legitimate customers or violate regulatory obligations. A KPI reference
table provides documentation for every metric used in the dashboard.


================================================================================
  PART 6 : DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS (15 Insights)
================================================================================

Insight 1 — Revenue-Profit Disconnect
    Gross revenue of GBP 8.91M masks a significant profit leakage: GBP 611K in
    return losses consumes 17.1% of estimated gross profit. The retailer's
    top-line growth is partially illusory when measured against true bottom-line
    impact.

Insight 2 — Extreme Return Concentration
    Only 67 products (3.4% of all returned products) account for 80% of total
    return losses. This is a textbook Pareto distribution that makes targeted
    intervention far more efficient than blanket policy changes.

Insight 3 — High-Price Items Are Disproportionately Returned
    Products in the GBP 50-1000 price band exhibit significantly higher return
    rates than lower-price bands. Since these items carry the highest absolute
    revenue per unit, each return inflicts outsized financial damage.

Insight 4 — A Small Customer Cohort Drives Major Losses
    High-risk customers (those with return rates above 40% and return losses in
    the top quartile) represent a small fraction of the customer base but account
    for a disproportionate share of total return losses. Targeted policy
    interventions for this segment would have minimal impact on the broader
    customer experience.

Insight 5 — Customer Retention Decays Rapidly
    The cohort analysis reveals that only approximately 20-35% of customers
    acquired in a given month return to purchase in the following month. By month
    six, retention typically falls below 15%. This means the retailer depends
    heavily on continuous acquisition — amplifying the damage of returns, since
    many returns come from first-time buyers who never return.

Insight 6 — Geographic Concentration of Returns
    While the United Kingdom dominates transaction volume (accounting for over
    90% of transactions), several smaller markets exhibit return rates 2-3x
    higher than the UK baseline, suggesting localisation issues (incorrect
    product expectations, shipping delays, or currency/size mismatches).

Insight 7 — Time-of-Week Return Patterns
    Return rates are not uniform across the week. Certain weekdays show elevated
    return rates, potentially correlating with post-weekend delivery receipt
    patterns or batch-processing of returns.

Insight 8 — Monthly Seasonality in Return Losses
    Return losses are not proportional to revenue throughout the year. Certain
    months (particularly following peak sales periods such as the holiday season)
    show disproportionate return spikes, indicating a lag between gifting
    purchases and recipient-initiated returns.

Insight 9 — Net Profit Sensitivity to Return Rates
    A 25% reduction in return losses would lift estimated net profit by
    approximately GBP 176K — a 6% improvement. Conversely, a 25% increase would
    erode a further GBP 176K, demonstrating the symmetric risk exposure.

Insight 10 — Return Processing Costs Amplify Losses
    When return processing overhead (shipping, restocking, quality inspection) is
    modelled at a 1.15x multiplier, the true economic impact of returns rises
    from GBP 611K to approximately GBP 703K — adding nearly GBP 92K in hidden
    operational costs.

Insight 11 — Category-Level Variability
    Product categories (proxied by the leading word of the product description)
    show wide variability in return rates, ranging from under 2% to over 30%.
    Categories with above-average return rates often correspond to items where
    physical attributes (size, colour, texture) are difficult to evaluate online.

Insight 12 — Repeat Returners vs One-Time Returners
    A substantial proportion of return losses come from customers who have
    returned products on multiple separate occasions, not from isolated incidents.
    This "serial returner" behaviour suggests policy loopholes rather than
    product-quality issues.

Insight 13 — Revenue Band and Return Rate Relationship
    Low-value transactions (GBP 0-2 band) generate the highest volume of returns
    in absolute count, but high-value transactions generate the most return losses
    in monetary terms. This suggests two distinct intervention strategies: volume
    reduction for low-value items and loss reduction for high-value items.

Insight 14 — Missing Customer Data Limits Full Analysis
    24.9% of original records lacked CustomerID, which were excluded from
    analysis. These represent potentially significant unattributed return losses.
    If these customers have higher return rates than identified customers, the
    true profit leakage may be materially understated.

Insight 15 — Hour-of-Day Patterns Suggest Operational Windows
    Certain hours of the business day show notably higher return rates, which may
    correlate with customer service staffing levels or automated return-processing
    systems. Aligning intervention resources (e.g., proactive customer contact)
    with these windows could intercept returns before they are finalised.

================================================================================
  PART 8 : ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS DISCUSSION
================================================================================

8.1  Customer Fairness and Consumer Rights
──────────────────────────────────────────

Return-reduction strategies must operate within the legal framework of consumer
protection legislation. In the UK (the primary market), the Consumer Rights Act
2015 grants consumers a 14-day unconditional return window for distance sales,
and a 30-day window for faulty goods. Any tiered return policy must not infringe
upon these statutory rights. Restricting returns for flagged customers must be
limited to discretionary (non-statutory) extensions and must never penalise
legitimate quality complaints.

8.2  Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance
──────────────────────────────────────

The customer-level return-behaviour profiling conducted in this analysis
constitutes processing of personal data under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). Key compliance requirements include:

  - Purpose limitation: Return-behaviour data should only be used for legitimate
    business purposes (fraud prevention, service improvement), not sold or shared
    with third parties.
  - Data minimisation: Only the minimum customer data necessary for the analysis
    should be retained.
  - Right to explanation: If a customer is placed in a restricted-return tier,
    they have the right to understand why and to contest the decision.
  - Anonymisation: Analytical outputs shared in reports or dashboards should use
    anonymised customer identifiers.

8.3  Algorithmic Bias in Risk Segmentation
──────────────────────────────────────────

The risk-segmentation model assigns customers to High / Medium / Low tiers based
on return rate and absolute return loss. This model could inadvertently
disadvantage certain groups:

  - Geographic bias: Customers in countries with longer shipping times may have
    higher return rates due to delivery damage, not behavioural intent.
  - Socioeconomic bias: Customers purchasing lower-priced items in bulk may
    appear as "serial returners" when in fact they are making legitimate
    quantity adjustments.

Regular auditing of the segmentation model against demographic and geographic
fairness criteria is essential.

8.4  Transparency of Policy Changes
────────────────────────────────────

Any operational changes driven by this analysis (e.g., modified return windows,
restocking fees, or flagging mechanisms) must be communicated to customers
proactively and in advance. Retroactive application of stricter policies — where
customers are penalised for past behaviour under rules that did not exist at the
time — is ethically indefensible and legally questionable.

8.5  Proportionality of Interventions
──────────────────────────────────────

Not all returns are harmful. Product-quality returns signal genuine manufacturing
or description issues that, if addressed, improve the business long-term. The
recommendations in this analysis are designed to be proportional: severe
interventions (account restrictions) are reserved for the small High-Risk
segment, while broader interventions (better product descriptions, AR tools)
benefit all customers. This graduated approach ensures that the 95%+ of
customers who return products rarely are not subjected to unnecessary friction.


================================================================================
  PART 9 : LIMITATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

9.1  Absence of Cost Data

    The dataset provides only revenue-side information (Quantity and UnitPrice).
    All profit calculations rely on an assumed 40% gross margin, which may not
    accurately reflect the retailer's actual cost structure. Products with varying
    margins would produce different profit-erosion figures. The Profit Lift
    Simulator partially mitigates this by allowing users to adjust the margin
    assumption, but exact figures require real cost data.

9.2  Missing CustomerID Records

    135,080 rows (24.9% of the original dataset) were excluded because CustomerID
    was null. If these rows have a systematically different return profile than
    retained rows, the analysis could be biased. Specifically, if unidentified
    customers have higher return rates, the true profit leakage is understated.

9.3  Proxy Product Categorisation

    The dataset does not include a formal product category hierarchy. The proxy
    used (first word of Description) is crude and produces noisy categories. An
    official product taxonomy would enable far more precise category-level
    insights.

9.4  No Return Reason Data

    The dataset identifies that a return occurred but not why. Without return
    reason codes (e.g., wrong size, damaged in transit, not as described,
    changed mind), root-cause analysis is limited. The recommendations are
    therefore inferred from patterns rather than confirmed by causal evidence.

9.5  Single-Year Observation Window

    The data spans approximately 12 months (December 2010 — December 2011).
    Year-over-year trend analysis is not possible, and seasonal patterns may not
    be representative of longer-term cycles. Conclusions about seasonality should
    be treated as indicative rather than definitive.

9.6  Currency Assumption

    All monetary values are assumed to be in British Pounds (GBP), consistent
    with the UK-centric customer base. For international transactions, exchange
    rate effects are not modelled.

9.7  Return Processing Costs

    The true cost of processing a return (shipping, inspection, restocking,
    potential write-off) is unknown. The dashboard's cost multiplier slider
    (1.0x to 1.5x) provides sensitivity analysis but cannot replace actual
    operational cost data.

  PART 10 : FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

10.1 Integration of Actual Cost Data
    Partnering with finance and logistics to incorporate true COGS, fulfilment
    costs, and return-processing costs per SKU would transform estimated profit
    figures into exact ones, dramatically improving the reliability of the Profit
    Lift Simulator.

10.2 Return Reason Classification
    Implementing a return-reason taxonomy (quality defect, size mismatch, delivery
    damage, changed mind, etc.) would enable causal analysis rather than
    correlational pattern-matching, allowing far more targeted interventions.

10.3 Predictive Return Modelling
    Developing a machine-learning model (e.g., logistic regression, gradient
    boosting) to predict the probability of return at the point of sale — using
    features such as product category, customer history, price band, and country
    — would enable pre-emptive interventions (e.g., enhanced product previews,
    proactive size-confirmation prompts).

10.4 A/B Testing Framework
    Building an A/B testing infrastructure to empirically validate intervention
    effectiveness (e.g., testing enhanced product descriptions against current
    listings for the top-67 return-loss products) would move the analysis from
    recommendation to measured impact.

10.5 Real-Time Dashboard Deployment
    Connecting the dashboard to a live database (rather than a static Excel file)
    and deploying it on a cloud infrastructure (e.g., Streamlit Cloud, AWS)
    would enable continuous monitoring and early-warning alerts when return rates
    exceed dynamic thresholds.

10.6 Natural Language Processing for Product Descriptions
    Applying NLP to product descriptions to auto-generate standardised categories,
    sentiment-enriched labels, and keyword-based quality indicators would replace
    the current crude first-word proxy with a robust taxonomy.

10.7 Customer Lifetime Value Integration
    Incorporating CLV calculations alongside return-loss data would enable the
    retailer to distinguish between high-value customers with occasional returns
    (worth retaining with lenient policies) and low-value serial returners (worth
    restricting), further refining the risk-segmentation model.

10.8 Multi-Year Longitudinal Analysis
    Extending the dataset to cover multiple years would enable year-over-year
    trend analysis, confirming whether return rates are genuinely increasing and
    whether seasonal patterns are stable or evolving.

  PART 11 : TWO-MINUTE VIDEO PRESENTATION SCRIPT
================================================================================

[SLIDE 1 — Title]

Good morning. My name is Astitva, and today I will present my Data Analytics
project on profit leakage in online retail — specifically, how product returns
silently erode profitability even when revenue appears healthy.

[SLIDE 2 — Problem]

The core problem is this: an online retailer shows GBP 8.9 million in gross
revenue over a 12-month period, yet an estimated GBP 611,000 leaks out through
product returns. That does not sound like a large percentage — roughly 7% — but
when you measure it against gross profit rather than revenue, returns consume
over 17% of the profit base. The gap between revenue growth and profit decline
is driven by these returns.

[SLIDE 3 — Dataset and Methodology]

I used the UCI Online Retail dataset from Kaggle, containing 541,000 transaction
records across 38 countries. After cleaning — removing records without customer
identification, null descriptions, and non-transactional rows — I retained
407,000 records. Returns were identified by cancelled invoice codes and negative
quantities. I engineered additional features: price bands, product categories,
time dimensions, and customer segmentation tiers.

[SLIDE 4 — Dashboard Walkthrough]

The dashboard I built in Streamlit has five sections. First, an executive summary
showing all key financial metrics and a waterfall chart that traces how GBP 8.9
million narrows to GBP 2.95 million in net profit. Second, a product
intelligence tab where a Pareto analysis reveals that just 67 products — 3.4% of
returned items — account for 80% of losses. Third, a customer risk tab with
cohort retention heatmaps and a scatter plot mapping every customer on a
spend-vs-return-loss plane. Fourth, a profit simulator where stakeholders can
drag a slider to model the impact of reducing returns by any target percentage.
And fifth, an action tracker with prioritised recommendations and ethical
safeguards.

[SLIDE 5 — Key Insights]

Three findings stand out. First, the extreme Pareto concentration — fixing just
67 products could recover the majority of losses. Second, a small group of
high-risk customers accounts for a disproportionate share of returns, and
targeted policies would not affect 95% of the customer base. Third, higher-priced
items generate the largest per-unit return losses, suggesting that better product
presentation — augmented reality previews, detailed size guides — would have the
highest return on investment.

[SLIDE 6 — Business Impact]

The simulator shows that a 25% reduction in return losses would lift net profit
by approximately GBP 176,000 — a meaningful recovery with a focused intervention
on fewer than 70 products and a few hundred customer accounts. This is not a
speculation; it is a data-backed projection.

[CLOSING]

In summary, the retailer does not have a revenue problem — it has a profit
retention problem. And this analysis provides the precise map of where the leaks
are and how to seal them. Thank you.
